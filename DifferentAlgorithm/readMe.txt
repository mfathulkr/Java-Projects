Q2:
	Basically already sorted cases are the best case for this algorithm.
	Best Case BigO = O(n)
	Worst Case BigO = O(n^2)

Q3:
	This algorithm is not more efficient than the bubble sort. While the 
	bubble sort algorithm starts over with each round, it just applies 
	the process back and forth.
	
Q4:
	We just need to swap smaller one to right side. To do that we can change 
	the if conditions to "smaller than"(<) instead of "greater than"(>).
